            A trail that leads to the most picturesque part of the Shar
            Mountain. It starts with the information board placed before the
            entry in the village of Bozovce. The trail is spatially divided into
            two parts. The first part is from the village of Bozovce to
            Leshnica. The track moves from the right side, above the village of
            Bozovce and continues as a dirt road. The trail moves onto the
            southern slope of Sheremetnica and passes through meadows that were
            once cultivated by the villagers. Descending to Leshnica, the trail
            enters a belt of beech forest. Here the trail passes through
            Leshnica, located in the heart of the Shar Mountain and represents
            the most picturesque spot of Shar Mountain. The second part of the
            trail continues to Krivoshija or the valley between the second and
            third Leshnichka Karpa. After passing the River Krivoshiska and
            going deep into Krivoshija the trail continues to the waterfall.
            Moving along this path, every step offers a new view of the
            Leshnichki Karpi and Titov Vrv. An ubiquitous part of this trail are
            the mountain goats. The trail ends at the Krivoshiski Falls.
            Visiting this place in the summer is wonderfully refreshing. The
            trail then continues back along the same road up to the village of
            Bozovce

          <div class="fondoTrails">
            The trail starts from the village of Podgorci. The trail goes on a
            dirt road that leads through a beech forest and reaches to
            Podgorecki Bacila. Moving along this path, on three occasions, a
            broad grassy area or meadow is passed. Shortly after the sheep
            farms, crossing the so-called “golinska skala” vast grasslands are
            reached. From this point, moving along a better regulated mountain
            path will lead to, initially, the small Lake Podgorecko and shortly
            after the large Lake Podgorecko. Passing the lake, a detour on the
            left is made on a steep trail to reach to the top of Crn Kamen. From
            the top the trail descends to a rocky grass area to Vevchanska Lokva
            where it continues through sheep farms in Vevcani. From the sheep
            farms, on a dirt road through the beech forest, the trail goes along
            the banks of the River Crven Kladenec and the dry area Esejnca,
            where by descending, it ends at Vevcani Springs. The trail may be
            continued towards the Albanian side through the green pass, which is
            marked on the map. The instructions for passing the green areas are
            given in the relevant chapter of this guidebook. The trail on the
            Albanian side is explained as the following trail with the title BHA
            A4.

            The trail begins in the village of Dihovo, near “Villa Dihovo”. The
            first part of the trail passes through the village then follows the
            paved road (Bitola – Nizepole) from where the trail continues on a
            mountain path leading to the monastery “St. Atanas”. The ground on
            this part of the trail is covered with sand and soft grass. The
            trail continues through the forest belt with mixed beech, pine and
            birch forest. The second part of the trail starts from the church
            “St. Atanas” to “Jorgov Kamen” at 1.744 masl. The mountain trail
            from “Jorgov Kamen” gently descends to the mountain lodge Kopanki,
            from here it descends to the Hotel “Molika” where it eventually
            ends. This part of the trail is in the “Pelister” National Park, and
            it moves through Molika forest.

            The route starts in the village of Zhirovnica, to be precise, the so
            called “Gorno maalo” (the upper neighborhood) of the village. This
            route is very interesting and significant because it used to be the
            trail for commercial exchange between the village of Zhirovnica and
            the neighboring villages from Albania. The route goes to the most
            hidden part of the Republic of Macedonia. Just 2 km outside the
            village is the spring “Medoshnica”, which is believed by the locals
            to have healing powers. From the spring, along the basin of River
            Tairovska, the route continues westward to the foothill of the area
            called “Mala Planina” (Small Mountain), and then northwest passing
            through the area called “Tri Sinora” under the peak Plocha. 2 km
            from Plocha in the northwest is the crossing Shkrtec, the end of the
            route. The way back is along the same route.
