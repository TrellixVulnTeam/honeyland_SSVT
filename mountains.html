      <div id="sharDescription">
        Shar Mountain is situated in the northwestern part of the Republic of
        Macedonia. The massif extends from the northeast to the southwest for 80
        km with a total surface area of around 1.600 km2, making it one of the
        largest massifs in the Balkans. Shar Mountain can be divided into three
        segments (though heterogeneous), according to its geological composition
        and its common geographical characteristics: Northeastern segment;
        Northwestern or central segment; Southern segment. The approximate
        height of the mountain range is 2.200 m with Titov Vrv being the highest
        peak (2.747 m). It begins with the River Lepenec and with the peak of
        Ljuboten, 2.499 m. It ends with Morava summit, 2.147 m, and Lake
        Mavrovo. Shara Mountain massif belongs to a group of young mountain
        chains and is characterized by a mountainous climate with cold winters
        and pleasant summers. At an elevation of 1.300 m the snow averages a
        depth of 1m and usually lasts for four months. The Eyes of Shar
        Mountain, as its glacial lakes are popularly known, are its special
        characteristic. There are 25 lakes that are constant, over 150
        occasional lakes and as many smaller ponds. The water potential of this
        massif is huge and it has 200 springs of pure water. Among others, the
        mineral richness is represented by manganese, iron, chrome, molybdenum,
        and copper.

      <img src="pictures/jablanica1.jpg" class="sizeImage" />
      <div id="sharDescription">
        Macedonia. It is situated between the Ohrid-Struga Valley and the Debar
        Valley, to the west of the River Black Drin (Valley and the shore-line
        of Lake Ohrid. The eastern side of the mountain belongs to the Republic
        of Macedonia, while the western side belongs to the Republic of Albania.
        It stretches in a meridian direction with a length of 35 km, and its
        greatest width in our country is 7.5 km. The part of the mountain on
        Macedonian territory covers an area of 255 km2. Jablanica is a fold
        mountain formed by the Oligo-Miocene tectonic movements. Its geological
        structure is represented by Paleozoic shale on the mountain slopes,
        covered by Triassic limestone. The topography of Jablanica is dominated
        by high mountain peaks, wide expanses, deep river gorges, and by karts
        and glacial landforms. Its highest peak is Crn Kamen (2.257 m.), and it
        has several other peaks higher than 2.000 m, such as: Strizak (2.233 m),
        Krstec (2.186 m), and Cumin Vrv (2.125 m). The fossil glacial features
        are represented by five cirques that enclose the four glacial lakes:
        Vevcani, Podgorje, Upper and Lower Labuniste. The mountain abounds in
        water, and the most famous springs are the ones in Vevcani, which are a
        tourism attraction in their own right. In terms of mineral resources,
        there is a coalmine near the village of Piskupstina.

      <p id="sharTitle"><a name="baba"></a> Baba Mountain</p>
      <img src="pictures/baba1.jpg" class="sizeImage" />
      <div id="sharDescription">
        A mountain massif located in the southwest of the Republic of Macedonia,
        with Pelister as its highest peak (2.601 m). By virtue of the
        multi-staged tectonic activities, the mountain rises in a typical horst
        between the Pelagonia Valley to the east and the Prespa Valley to the
        west. To the north, via the mountain pass Gjavato (1.167 m) and Capari
        field, it is morphologically separated from the Bigla Mountain (1.656
        m), while to the south it continues in Greece, all the way up to the
        mountain pass Vigla (1.505 m), along the Florina – Kastoria road. It
        stretches along the meridian to a total length of 35 km. The border
        between Macedonia and Greece passes through its southern parts. Within
        the territory of our country it covers an area of 436 km2. The dominant
        geomorphologic form of the high mountain area is the main ridge of the
        mountain, which also serves as a water divide between the Adriatic and
        the Aegean basins. Apart from Pelister, there are several other mountain
        peaks rising above 2.000 m from the ridge. Those are the following: Stiv
        (2.468 m), Visoka Cuka (2.182 m), Vrteska (2.010 m), Ilinden (2.542 m),
        Golemo Stapalo and (2.415 m).

      <img src="pictures/galichica1.jpg" class="sizeImage" />
      <div id="sharDescription">
        A mountain situated in the outermost southwest part of the Republic of
        Macedonia, which, in the form of a typical horst, rises in between the
        Ohrid Valley to the west and the Prespa Valley to the east. To the north
        it is continued by the mountains of Petrino and Istok, and by the Bukovo
        col (1.207 m) it is morphologically separated from the Plaken Mountain.
        It stretches 50 km along the meridian, and its smallest width is between
        the village of Trpejca and the village of Leskoec (10 km). Only the
        southernmost parts of Galichica rise above 2.000 m. Its part south of
        Zli Dol is called Old Galichica. It is the highest part of the national
        park with the most remarkable relief. Its sides cut steeply toward the
        lakes and are furrowed with dry ravines, which give the mountain an
        inaccessible look. It lowest points are at the level of Lake Ohrid (695
        m.) and the level of Lake Prespa (850 m), with its highest peak being
        Magaro (2.255 m), and there is another peak at an altitude of 2.275 m
        situated on the very border with Albania.
